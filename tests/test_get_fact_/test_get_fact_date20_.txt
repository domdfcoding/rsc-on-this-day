James Dewar gave the first lecture on air at the Royal Institution, London on this day in 1893
Air, gaseous and liquid were a series of six well-illustrated lectures given by the Scottish physical chemist. For example, some of the air in the room was liquefied in the presence of the audience and it remained so for some time, when enclosed in a vacuum jacket.
