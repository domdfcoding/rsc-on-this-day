British mineralogist William Gregor was born on this day in 1761
He discovered the element titanium (Ti), which he originally named manaccanite after the Manaccan valley where he found it. A few years later, it was rediscovered by Martin Klaproth who thought it was a new element and gave it the current name of titanium.
